## Hi there! 👋🏼

I’m currently enrolled at **Columbia Software Engineering Boot Camp** and learning **TypeScript, JavaScript, Node.js, HTML, CSS, and React.**
  - 🔭 I’m working on improving my front-end and back-end development skills, focusing on Node.js, TypeScript, and Web APIs.

  - 🌱 I’m currently building a browser game with Bootstrap and a React portfolio using Tailwind CSS for styling.
    
  - 💬 Ask me about coding bootcamps, TypeScript, Node.js, React, Web APIs, or JavaScript tips!

Check out my projects below!
